    T.I.D.Y ~/ˈtʌɪdi/
    Version 0.0.1 - 2020

```

## Installation

```sh
npx @neuralline/tidy

```

## Example

````````sh
type npx @neuralline/tidy to install
type tidy to see available options, atm [scan, up/remove, help]
type 'tidy scan' or 'tidy up' on your terminal to scan or remove all unnecessary files from your project directories and sub directories

```
## Description

```sh
Finds and Removes installed npm dependencies or node_modules, cache and other build time files/directories from your machine. If you are like me, clone git projects to test it out or use create-react-app a lot chances are there are huge npm dependencies installed every where. Sometimes twice [server, client].This cli app will help you keep your project neat and tidy

```````
## Why

```sh
- Tidy removes these watched build time files silently. Since these files are not meant to be tracked on git no further action required. type install when its time.

- No need to do it individually for each project. Tidy is automated

- Also provides other related information, like number of project directories with package.json etc...

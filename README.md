    Neat and controlled.
    T.I.D.Y ~/ËˆtÊŒÉªdi/
    cli version 0.0.3 - 2020

```

## Installation

```sh
npm i -g @neuralline/tidy
yarn add -g @neuralline/tidy

then you can use 'tidy' cli on your terminal

or
npx @neuralline/tidy

```

## Example

```sh
After installation
type 'tidy' to list available options, atm [scan, clean, help]
type 'tidy scan' or 'tidy up' on your terminal to scan or remove unnecessary files from your project directories and sub directories

```

## Description

```sh
Finds and Removes installed npm dependencies or node_modules, cache and other build time files/directories from your machine. If you are like me, clone git projects to test, revers engineer or use create-react-app a lot chances are there are huge npm dependencies installed every where. Sometimes twice [server, client]. This cli app will help you keep your project neat and tidy

```

## Why

```sh
- Tidy removes downloaded dependencies and build time files silently. Since these files are not meant to be tracked by git no further action required. type install when its time.

- No need to do it individually for each project. Tidy is automated

- Also provides other related information, like number of project directories with package.json etc...

- Uses all the latest technologies JavaScript and Node could offer in 2020



```

## Watched files

```sh
- clean removes [node_modules, .cache, .yarn, .pnp] files
- scan tracks [.vscode, .idea, .yarn-error.log, build , dist]


```
